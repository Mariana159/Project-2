        Abdu attends Debbie's game and watches from the front row. The Ferrets won the game!!! Their schools side of the gym 
        cheer wildly! After a long embrace with her team, Debbie lets go and faces the crowd to make an announcement. Just before she's
        about to speak, Abdu takes a knee and invites her to the spring dance! Debbie gladly accepts and hugs Abdu. She smiles, thinking her announcement
        can be told another time.
